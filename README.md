# Unity-SwitchSceneTimer

Scene Switch Timer (Text Legacy) & (Text Mesh Pro)
--------------------------------------------------

Description:

Primarily, this simple script(s) simply allows you to add a visible display timer in your scene UI Canvas that counts down to completion and then at the end of said timer countdown to then auto switch to the specified scene via SceneManager. For example: say you have a small start zone scene for players to run around in like in most battle royales just for one example and then you want to send the player to a specific scene after a specified time, that is what this simple script does.

 EXTRAS:
---------


 TestStuff Controller
-------------------------

Description:

 Most example instructions need some sort of "test plane / terrain" and a "characterController" to test things out, thus one would not be able to test such if they do not already have one to test stuff with. As such, provided here is just a simple 
 "tester controller" provided for testing stuff if the end-user needs such and does not already have something.
